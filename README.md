# JuiceBox

The juicebox is an ESP32 based device that is used for controlling reticulation solenoid valves via relays. This repo has a few branches of different technologies that have been testing, a rPi based ReST API, a system using webSockets and a MQTT client solution. I ended up settling on MQTT as it provided the best performance with the least overhead.
